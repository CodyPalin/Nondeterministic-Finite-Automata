# Project 1 part 2: Nondeterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Cody Palin and Dominick Edmonds
* Class: CS361 Section 1
* Semester: Spring 2019

## Overview

This program takes an input NFA and converts it into an equivilent DFA,
which it then simulates and verifys the provided language can be accepted by it.

## Compiling and Using

Similar to the previous project, the progam to run is the NFADriver class,
and it's parameter is the file (matching the outlined format on the project specs)
you would like to test

## Discussion



Discuss the issues and successes you encountered during programming
(development). Here are some questions to get you started. You don't
have to answer all of them in order - they are a guideline to get you
thinking.
  * What problems did you have? What went well?
  * What process did you go through to create the program?
  * What did you have to research and learn on your own?
  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
  * Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process 
  of working on this project?
  * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
  * Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?

## Testing

In addition to the provided test cases, we made *!!* more tests
